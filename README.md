NodeJS using Express to connect a simple CRUD to MariaDB

<h1>Important:</h1>
#If you have previously installed mySQL, it is neeeded to change the port, by default is 3306, change to another port exlucding 3000 or 4200. Those ones are the common of angular and react (can be changed)
#On dbCon file it is needed to specify the port if it was changed, else. It won't connect to the DB
#renember to pool.release or end to avoid crashing trough memory leaks
